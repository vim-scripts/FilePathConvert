DESCRIPTION
This plugin converts a file path and name that is inserted into the buffer
between absolute and relative paths. This is especially useful after pasting
in or completing (i_CTRL-X_CTRL-F) filespecs.

RELATED WORKS
- html_FileCompletion.vim (vimscript #4070) is insert mode completion of
  URL-escaped file links relative to a document root and base URL.

USAGE
<Leader>sf              Convert the file whose name is under or after the
                        cursor to a more local one:
                        URL -> [ UNC -> ] absolute -> relative (-> absolute)
{Visual}<Leader>sf      Convert the selected file name.

<Leader>sF              Convert the file whose name is under or after the
                        cursor to a more global one:
                        relative -> absolute  -> [ UNC -> ] URL (-> UNC / abs)
{Visual}<Leader>sF      Convert the selected file name.

                        A relative file path (../foo) is converted to an
                        absolute one (/home/user/dir/foo).
                        An absolute file path (/home/user/dir/foo) is
                        converted to a relative one (../foo).
                        On Windows, an absolute filespec starts with a drive
                        letter (C:\foo).
                        A URL starts with a protocol like file://; the actual
                        protocol is ignored here. Or it is a Windows file
                        share in UNC notation (\\host\share\foo).
                        Unless a mapping of URL prefix to mount point exists
                        (see g:FilePathConvert_UrlMappings), this can only
                        be mapped to a generic share in UNC notation.

EXAMPLE
Here's a simple illustration:
    :cd C:\Windows\Temp
    :edit test.txt
The text
    C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
is turned into:
    ..\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
and
    Cookies\index.dat
is turned into:
    C:\Windows\Temp\Cookies\index.dat
